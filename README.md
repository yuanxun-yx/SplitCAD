> A GUI-first, Git-native CAD system ‚Äî like KiCad, but for 3D mechanical design

## ‚ùå What‚Äôs Broken in Today‚Äôs CAD

### üîÑ Git can‚Äôt track CAD files

* Files like `.sldprt` or `.f3d` are opaque binary blobs
* Even a tiny change shows up as a meaningless binary diff
* You can't review, merge, or collaborate cleanly
* PDM systems are heavy, locked-down, and hostile to Git workflows

### üß© Parametric logic is fragile, limited, and hard to manage

* Cross-part references rely on absolute paths ‚Äî breaking easily when assemblies are moved or renamed
* There‚Äôs no support for modularity ‚Äî expressions can‚Äôt be scoped across files, reused as functions, or composed into structured logic
* Failures from circular dependencies or broken links are hard to trace, with no clear logs or dependency graph
* All logic must be rebuilt through the GUI, with no way to automate or replicate via scripts


## ‚úÖ A Better Paradigm: CAD like Code

SplitCAD is built on two core ideas:

### 1. GUI-first, logic-tracked

* Model your part in a clean, visual interface
* Every feature (sketch, extrude, pattern, etc) maps to an explicit source entry
* No hidden state - everything is tracked and reproducible

### 2. Source/Result separation ‚Äî like code and build artifacts

| Concept        | Software Project      | SplitCAD                      |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Source         | `.cpp`, `.h`          | `.yaml`, `.json`              |
| Build Artifact | `.o`, `.obj`          | `.cache.cad`                  |
| Final Output   | `.exe`, `.wasm`, `.a` | `.step`, `.stl`, `.png`       |
| Compiler       | `gcc`, `clang`        | kernel (e.g. Open Cascade)    |
| CI/CD          | GitHub Actions, etc.  | Model checks + preview builds |


* Git tracks what matters: modeling intent
* CI can rebuild geometry from clean source
* Exported formats like `.step` are final outputs, not modeling state
* Intermediate files (like `.cache.cad`) store geometry to speed up GUI preview or CI teasting, similar to `.o` files in software builds
* Build speed is not critical: geometry generation can be slower as long as results are cached, just like compilation in code projects
* GitHub diffs show `length: 10 -> 12`, not hex dumps
* **AI-friendly**: With human-readable source files instead of opaque binaries, it's possible to train LLMs to analyze, repair, or generate CAD logic ‚Äî similar to AI-assisted programming.

These ideas are not hypothetical. Tools like [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) have already proven the value of GUI-first, Git-native workflows in hardware design. KiCad stores structured text files (`.kicad_pcb`, `.sch`), enables readable diffs and reviewable PRs, and integrates cleanly with CI pipelines (e.g. [KiBot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot)). SplitCAD extends this proven paradigm to the domain of 3D mechanical CAD.

## üß† Lessons from Compiler History

Like compilers before GCC or LLVM, CAD tools have long been opaque, closed, and expensive. Once compilers became open and standardized, the ecosystem flourished ‚Äî from static analysis to AI tooling.

**CAD may be next.**
Open geometry kernels like Open Cascade could fill the role LLVM played for compilers ‚Äî providing a foundation for analysis, AI tooling, and new user paradigms.

## ü§ù Who is this for?

* Engineers tired of binary CAD files in Git
* Small teams without expensive PDM systems
* Hardware projects that want to work like software
* Developers who want PRs and semantic diffs, not blobs

## üìå Status

This is a **proposal** for a better CAD workflow paradigm.

I do not plan to build this myself ‚Äî but I hope it can inspire discussion or implementation by others. Feel free to fork, share, or reuse the ideas for as long as your project is either **open source** or **non-commercial**.
